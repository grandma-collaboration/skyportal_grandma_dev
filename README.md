Hey everyone!
In the project section, you'll find a "CANVA" where you can create tickets, and sort them in the "to do", "working on it", "stuck" and "done!" columns.
You can either create a simple ticket, or reference an issue.
Please only use issues, as they offer way more functionalities.
So go to Issues > Create an issue > Go to Project > Put the issue in the right section.

Tag me (@Theodlz) on the issues when you need help, or if you have any questions.

Good luck!

#### Task 1:

Each of you need to create an issue called "Your Name - Installing SkyPortal". In the issue's content, please list the different steps you took so far, and list any issues you encountered.
Then, add that issue in the "TO DO" column of the project section if you're doing ok for now, and move it to the "STUCK" section if you need any help.
